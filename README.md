# Portfolio Website
<p>A fully functional and responsive static website with an infinite scroll landing page showing my experience and projects as well as individual pages with further details. This was built entirely in pure code which was self-taught through a range of online resources and coded from a mobile first design approach. Some interesting features include navigation bar colour changes on scroll and outsourced dynamic site elements like the contact form.</p>
